What is Bitcoin?
----------------

https://www.bitcoin.org

Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Elements Alpha is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://www.bitcoin.org/en/download.

What is Sidechain Elements?
-----------------

Sidechain Elements is a collection of experiments to bring more technical innovation to Bitcoin.
